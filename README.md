About
-----

- `bashrc`: nothing extraordinary at all, only the lines beginning with the
  powerline settings are written by myself, all the other was shipped by
  default by [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). I've only set up powerline for
  bash, the nice `solarized` skin for `mc`, added a directory of my own
  often used scripts, and set up `vim` as my default editor.

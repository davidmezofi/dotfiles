About
-----

- `bashrc`: nothing extraordinary at all, only the lines beginning with the
  powerline settings are written by myself, all the other was shipped by
  default by [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). I've only set up powerline for
  bash, the nice `solarized.ini` skin for `mc`, added a directory of my own
  often used scripts, and set up `vim` as my default editor.

- `tmux.conf`: I've taken some ideas from [Tony
  Narlock](https://github.com/tony/tmux-config) -- he is the author of [The Tao
  of tmux](https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux)

- `vimrc`: some personal preferences, mostly results of googling around.

- `zathurarc`: [solarized
  colorscheme](https://github.com/lennonwoo/zathura-solarized) for the
  PDF-viewer `zathura`.
